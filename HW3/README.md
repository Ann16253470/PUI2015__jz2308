Include a README.md which describes what you are doing, and, if appropriate, how to run the notebook (input variables? global variables that need to be setup?).

In the assignment1, I generated 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 6 different distributions:
1.chi-square distribution 2.normal distributiono 3.poisson distribution 4.binomial distribution 5.gumbel distribution 6.laplace distribution

After add the numpy.random.seed(seed=10)in my ipynb, every time the result shoud be the same.
The distribution of the sample means of all 6 distributions look like the normal diatribution.

In the assignment2, I followed the steps given by teacher to do a z-test and a chi-square test.
Taking Î±=0.05, we fail to reject Null Hypothesis.
